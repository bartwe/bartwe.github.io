C#
```csharp
Parallel.Foreach(list, action);
```
splits the work early and doesn't do work stealing, if there are a few large work items mixed through a lot of quick ones you might end up with a lot of time being spent only working on one thread.

This can be worked around by using
```csharp
Parallel.ForEach(Partitioner.Create(inputs, EnumerablePartitionerOptions.NoBuffering), action);
```
which will keep more threads busy when work items are differently sized but can be less efficient if the action is tiny.
